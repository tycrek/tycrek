## :raised_eyebrow: Who am I

I am a self-taught full stack web dev. I have a passion for privacy, security, and open source. I first learned Java when I was 10 using a free course on [Cave of Programming](https://www.caveofprogramming.com/). I like programming, gaming, and learning new things.

## :computer: What I'm working on

- **[mandatum](https://github.com/tycrek/mandatum)** - An open-source Discord bot.
- **[Degoogle](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle)** - A huge list of alternatives to Google products. Privacy tips, tricks, and links.
- **[McServerman](https://github.com/tycrek/mcserverman)** - A web-based GUI for managing Minecraft servers.

## :gear: Future project ideas

- **[garage.py](https://github.com/tycrek/garage.py)** - Old project that allowed a Raspberry Pi to open a garage door using Twilio. I'd like to revisit this project once again.
- **Call flooder** - I had previously made a call flooder in Python to f*ck with scammer call centers. I have no idea where the code went so I'll have to rewrite it!
